# Inside Deep Learning - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the exercises from the book Inside Deep Learning. The solutions are implemented with modern tools and frameworks to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and efficiency.

## Tools and Frameworks Used
- **MLflow**:
  Used for tracking experiments, managing model versions, and ensuring reproducibility.
  Logs key metrics, parameters, and results for each exercise, so you can visualize and analyze the results efficiently.

- **Optuna**:
  Leveraged for hyperparameter optimization to find the best-performing models.
  Makes experimenting with different configurations both easy and effective.
